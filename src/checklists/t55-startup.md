    Adequate RPM is required before starting the engine.  Attempting to ignite the engine before the APU is at RUN RPM up will lead to flame out and possible engine damage.
    <br><br>
    In the event of ignition failure, shut down the engine, and confirm APU RPM NOMINAL. Once NOMINAL, repeat steps 5 and 6.

    Nominal refers to the RPM being in the green zone of the dial. Starting engines before the APU is fully spun up will lead to ignition failure.
