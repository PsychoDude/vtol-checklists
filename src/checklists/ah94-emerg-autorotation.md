8. Increase Collective Input AS REQUIRED
9. Perform Landing

# **Overview:**

Autorotation refers to the descending maneuver in which the engine is disengaged from the main rotor system and the rotor blades are driven solely by the upward flow of air through the rotor. It is analogous to the gliding flight of a fixed-wing aircraft. The most common reason for autorotation is an engine malfunction or failure, but autorotation can also be performed in the event of a complete tail rotor failure, or following loss of tail-rotor effectiveness. Primary control of the rate of descent is airspeed. Higher or lower airspeeds are obtained with the cyclic pitch control just as in normal flight. Rate of descent is high at zero airspeed, but even with no airspeed the rotor is quite effective, as it has nearly the drag coefficient of a parachute. An optimum landing maneuver stops all of vertical movement, horizontal movement and rotational movement within the craft to a perfect standstill. In practice a perfect landing is rarely achievable
