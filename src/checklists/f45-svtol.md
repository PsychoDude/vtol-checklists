# F-45A S/VTOL Preface

V/STOVL equipment onboard the F-45A is intended to be used in conjunction with an LHA-Type ship. F-45A is capable of performing V/STOVL operations from Forward Operating Bases or otherwise unprepared facilities, however due to the fragile and complex nature of the airframe, it is not recommended. For all V/STOVL operations, a <u>TWR above 0.95</u> is necessary.
