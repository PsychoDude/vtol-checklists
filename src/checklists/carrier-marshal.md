1. When cleared for a CASE 1, leave the stack with the carrier on your 9 O'clock.
2. Begin a lazy turn back to the carrier when it is at your 8 O’clock and shift to a right echelon formation.
3. Descend and maintain 800 feet, Decrease speed to 300 knots.
4. Enter the upwind and place the carrier underneath the left wing, then lower the arresting hook.
5. Overhead of the carrier, Flight lead will give the “Kiss off” Command, after which he will turn left and enter the break. This is called the Crosswind Leg.
6. Begin your separation count as briefed, the next aircraft will begin a 2G left hand lazy turn, and announce: “1-2 in the break”. Repeat for all aircraft in the flight.
7. During or directly after the lazy turn, set flaps to 2 and decelerate to an onspeed AOA of 8°.
8. Enter the downwind descend to 600ft, and perform pre-landing checks, when the carrier is again at your 8 O’clock, enter the base turn. After this turn, you will be in “the groove.” THE TURN ITSELF IS NOT THE GROOVE.
