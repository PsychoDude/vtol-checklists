# EF-24G Carrier Landing Preface

When Landing Gear is DOWN, Hook DOWN, and Carrier Lights ON(Final Approach), the IFLOLS is visible in your lower-left HUD. Information is relayed via a data-link connection to the carrier. Prioritize use of the HUD IFLOLS over the physical IFLOLS whenever possible, especially in low visibility.

During carrier landings, aim to keep your AOA at 8 degrees. Adjust speed accordingly
