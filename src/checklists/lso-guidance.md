# LSO Guidance

After calling the ball, the LSO will give guidance down from ¾ miles. If Clara Ball has been called, it will begin immediately.

The commands are as follows:

-   Come Left - turn slightly left
-   Right for Lineup - turn slightly right
-   Power - Climb. Increase throttle to compensate for lack of altitude
-   You’re too High - Descend. Reduce throttle to compensate for excess altitude
-   You’re Fast - Slow Down. Reduce throttle to compensate for excess speed
-   You’re Slow - Speed Up. Increase throttle to compensate for lack of speed
-   Wave Off! - WAVE OFF IMMEDIATELY, RE-ENTER A HOLDING PATTERN TO THE LEFT. SEE NEXT PAGE FOR PROCEDURES
-   Bolter! - You’ve touched the deck but missed the wires - go around! SEE BELOW FOR PROCEDURE
