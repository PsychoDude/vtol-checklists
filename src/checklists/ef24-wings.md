# EF24 Variable Geometry Wings

**Description:**

In order to reduce drag at increasing Mach numbers, the EF-24G’s wings have been designed to articulate, thus vastly increasing top speed and efficiency. The wings may either be manually controlled or automatically managed by the aircraft based on current indicated Mach.

**Basic Operation:**

-   In “AUTO” wings will move for balanced lift/drag ratio
-   FORWARD moves the wings fully out, maximizing lift
-   BACK moves the wings fully aft, minimizing drag at the cost of lift
-   If the wings are in any position other than FORWARD (or, full forward in AUTO) the FLAPS will not deploy
-   If FLAPS are down, the wings will not articulate, and a clicking noise may play to alert the pilot
