# T-55 Flight Controls Failure Checklist

1. Yaw:
    1. Guide the aircraft to a safe ditching location. Once the airframe is on a safe trajectory away from the civilian population, eject.
2. Roll:
    1. Guide the aircraft to a safe ditching location. Once the airframe is on a safe trajectory away from the civilian population, eject.
3. Pitch:
    1. Use power to control pitch, utilizing airbrake and flaps for additional authority. Maintain high airspeed. Do not attempt a landing. This is unsafe without pitch control. Instead, guide the aircraft to a safe ditching location. Once the airframe is on a safe trajectory away from the civilian population, eject.
