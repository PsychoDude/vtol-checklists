# F-45A Emergency Flight Controls Failure Checklist

# **Alternate Control Methods:**

1. Yaw:
    1. Utilize slight engine tilt to allow the 3D Reaction Control System (RCS) to activate.
2. Roll:
    1. Same as yaw.
3. Pitch:
    1. Use power to control pitch, utilizing airbrake and flaps for additional authority. Maintain high airspeed. Do not attempt a landing. This is unsafe without pitch control. Instead, guide the aircraft to a safe ditching location. Once the airframe is on a safe trajectory away from the civilian population, eject.
