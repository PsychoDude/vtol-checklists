# Flight Deck Overview

Before CATCC clears you to taxi, it is critical to ensure that all pilots are able to communicate using their aircraft radio and have received the required mission data. As such a pre-taxi series of checks is required.

Only after these checks have been completed and found to be satisfactory, will the commander give the “MISSION GO” order. After this order has been given pilots will be allowed to contact CATCC to request taxi clearance. Keep in mind that getting taxi clearance includes clearance for launching at your own discretion.

The flight deck is a busy, dangerous, and oftentimes confusing place. As such, it is important to keep good situational awareness and a little bit of common sense while operating on it. To ensure safety and efficiency during launch and landing operations, make sure you stay vigilant and follow the rules described in section

**FLIGHT DECK ETIQUETTE**

Pilots should not, under any circumstances be:

-   Blocking launch operations (sitting on top of the JBD or in front of a catapult)
-   Blocking landing operations (sitting on or inside of the foul line)
-   Distracting other pilots (clipping inside aircraft, hovering around them)
-   Performing any launches or landings without the express permission of CATCC.
-   Taxi around with the wings unfolded, only unfold when getting ready to launch.

Launch Ops best practices:

-   Look around you before locking in, as the JBD may hit somebody!
-   Lock Cat 4 in before Cat 3, as Cat 3’s JBD may block or hit the aircraft on Cat 4.
-   Watch the launches! Make sure that you both get a cool view and don’t hit anyone on your way out.

Landing Ops best practices:

-   Before crossing/fouling the deck, check your NAV page. If there are any flights in the upwind or later, wait until they have recovered first.
-   If someone is running LSO, don’t park yourself in the LSO spot.
-   DO NOT use cats 3 or 4 during recovery operations.
-   Don’t clutter comms if there’s a flight on final. They need to hear the LSO clearly and they need to focus.
