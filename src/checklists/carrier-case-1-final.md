![Carrier Landing Diagram](/images/carrier-case1.webp)

<br>

1. Begin descent from 800ft to 350ft before wings level transition.
2. Make sure to notify the LSO that you have entered the final by calling "Callsign, in the groove." Make this call when you are leveled out and established on the final approach.
3. Begin MLA Scan after wings level transition.
   Meatball (Velocity Vector)
   Lineup (alignment with BRC)
   Angle of Attack (Onspeed AOA)
4. Call the Ball at 0.75nm, "Callsign, (Aircraft Name) Ball, (Fuel State in thousands)".
5. The LSO will respond "Callsign, fly the Ball" OR will begin relaying corrections for a successful trap. (High, Low, Left, Right, Slow, Fast).
6. Always aim to get a 3 wire, as this is the wire with the largest room for error.
7. Make sure you are familiar with the HUD symbology (E-Bracket, IFLOLS, AOA readout, Velocity Vector). Attempting to trap with the wrong AOA is a surefire way to bolter.
