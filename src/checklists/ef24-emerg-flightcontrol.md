# EF-24G Emergency Flight Controls Failure Checklist

# **Alternate Control Methods:**

1. Yaw:
    1. (If split throttle available) Cut power for the engine corresponding with the turn direction. Compensate roll.
    2. (If split throttles unavailable) Shut down the engine corresponding with turn direction. Compensate roll
2. Roll:
    1. Same as yaw, but compensate with yaw instead of pitch
3. Pitch:
    1. Flight Assist Master OFF. Use power to control pitch, utilizing airbrake and flaps for additional authority. Maintain high airspeed. Do not attempt a landing. This is unsafe without pitch control. Instead, guide the aircraft to a safe ditching location. Once the airframe is on a safe trajectory away from civilian population, eject.
