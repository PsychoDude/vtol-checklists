The VCAP button on the left is only enabled with a <u>TWR of 1.04</u> or higher. VCAP is a mode that allows the pilot to easily match the speed of a moving ship for landing. The control system changes the inputs of the plane

1. Throttle increases forward/back movement.
2. Throttle should be CENTERED after pressing the VCAP button.
3. Pushing the stick forward decreases altitude.
4. Pulling the stick backward increases altitude.
5. Moving the stick left or right moves the plane laterally, like a helicopter.
6. Rudder rotates the orientation of the plane.

    Throttle placement guidance: In order to hover the bar should be half filled and aligned with the middle notch.  If the bar is filled higher/forward of the notch, the plane will move forward.  If the bar is lower than the notch, the plane will move backward.
