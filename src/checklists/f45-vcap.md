The VCAP button on the left is only enabled with a <u>TWR of 1.04</u> or higher. VCAP is a mode that allows the pilot to easily match the speed of a moving ship for landing. The control system changes the inputs of the plane

1. Throttle increases forward/back movement.
2. Throttle should be CENTERED after pressing the VCAP button.
3. Pushing the stick forward decreases altitude.
4. Pulling the stick backward increases altitude.

    Throttle placement guidance: In order to hover the bar should be half filled and aligned with the middle notch.  If the bar is filled higher/forward of the notch, the plane will move forward.  If the bar is lower than the notch, the plane will move backward.
